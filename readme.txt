== Description ==

IAMSocial WordPress Theme wants to give the opportunity to small businesses owners and young entrepreneurs to create a simple, but modern looking website, and to easily connect their social media. IAMSocial is customizable, intuitive, easy to use, and responsive. It includes features that extend WordPress capabilities: users can create their own slider and choose from sets of colors and fonts to customize their design. IAMSocial supports internationalization and RTL formats and respects web standards and accessibility.

A few notes about the sections above:

* Responsive Layout
* Custom Colors
* Custom Header
* Custom Slider
* Social Links
* Custom footer
* Page templates
* Internationalization
* RTL support
* The GPL v2.0 or later license. :) Use it to make something cool and always share your work!

This theme is built upon Bootstrap 3. 

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's ZIP file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate.

== Basic set up ==

1. Add a menu in the "Primary Menu" area  
2. Add menu or widget in the different footer area: left, center and right.

== Customization ==

* Under “Appearance/Customize” you can set up the slider for your homepage, change the colors and the fonts for your theme look and feel and add your social media in the top navigation bar.
	1. IAMSocial General Settings: Change your colors and your fonts.
	2. IAMSocial Slider: Upload three images for your slider, set up its legends, colors and links (Note: Do not input the 'http://' part for the links). Choose an image from your computer (recommended size: 960px x 345px ). 
	3. IAMSocial Social Media Icons: Link your social media accounts. Note: Do not input the 'http://' part.
* Configure your widgets: 
	1. Configure the Top bar widgets: Ideal for search bar or Custom menu. Note: It is recommended to use only one widget in this area. If you do not set up any widgets in this area, by defaut, the search bar will show.
	2. Configure your sidebar: Add widgets here and these will appear on the side of any default page or post. Ideal for listing pages, archives or recent posts. 
	3. Use the three footer areas (left, center and right) to drag the widgets of your choice.
